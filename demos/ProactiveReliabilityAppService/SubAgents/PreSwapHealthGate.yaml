    Goal: Before promoting the staging slot to production, validate that the staging slot's
    response time is not regressed vs the stored baseline. Block the slot swap if the staging
    slot is already slow, and report the result to Teams.

    Resource Info:

   Web App Resource ID: /subscriptions/06dbbc7b-2363-4dd4-9803-95d07f1a8d3e/resourceGroups/rg-sre-proactive-demo/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/sreproactive-vscode-39596

   Application Insights App ID: 7610dc41-4e90-41d9-8a3b-e60e0f2d212e

   Application Insights Name: sreproactive-vscode-39596-ai

   Application Insights Resource ID: /subscriptions/06dbbc7b-2363-4dd4-9803-95d07f1a8d3e/resourceGroups/rg-sre-proactive-demo/providers/microsoft.insights/components/sreproactive-vscode-39596-ai

    Tasks:

    1. Connect to Application Insights using the Resource ID above.

    2. Run App Insights Query to measure staging slot response time over the last 5 minutes:
       let startTime = ago(5m);
       let endTime = now();
       requests
       | where timestamp between (startTime .. endTime)
       | where cloud_RoleName contains "staging"
       | summarize StagingResponseTime = avg(duration) by cloud_RoleName
       | extend StagingTimestamp = endTime

    3. Locate Baseline from Knowledge Store. Locate baseline.txt from Knowledge using available search/memory tools.
       Do not use any other knowledge - only use baseline.txt.

    4. Parse Baseline Values. Parse the file for BaselineResponseTime and BaselineTimestamp.
       If multiple values are present, select the most recent by timestamp.

    5. Compare Timestamps. Compare StagingTimestamp with BaselineTimestamp. Only proceed to the
       next step if StagingTimestamp is newer than BaselineTimestamp.

    6. Evaluate Staging Health Gate. Compare StagingResponseTime with BaselineResponseTime.
       - If StagingResponseTime is greater than BaselineResponseTime by 20% or more:
         * Do NOT execute the slot swap.
         * Set gate result to BLOCKED with reason "staging response time regressed vs baseline".
       - Otherwise:
         * Execute the slot swap:
           az webapp deployment slot swap --resource-group rg-sre-proactive-demo --name sreproactive-vscode-39596 --slot staging --target-slot production
         * Set gate result to PASSED.

    7. Post to Teams Channel at:
       <YOUR_TEAMS_CHANNEL_URL>

    Teams Post Format:

    Pre-Swap Health Gate: <app name>

    <one line summary>

    ---

    Staging Avg Response Time (last 5m): <time from app insights>ms

    Baseline Response Time: <time from knowledge>ms

    Deviation vs Baseline: <deviation %>

    Gate Result: <PASSED / BLOCKED>

    Reason: <reason if blocked, or "staging within 20% of baseline" if passed>

    Slot Swap Executed: <Yes/No>

    App Insights Query: <actual query with timestamps>

    Constraints:

    - No Fabrication: If the file or metric is not found, ask a single clarifying question and stop.

    - Follow Order: Follow the tasks in order.

    - No Approval Needed: Do not ask for approval before executing or blocking the swap.

    - Time Units: Response time is always in ms.

    - Teams Format: Always follow the Teams posting format exactly.

    Output: Output should be in rich HTML format.
